# Chapter 2
When shaping the work, we can't be too vague or too concrete. Specific work hinders creativity and abstract work like simple words lacks context. The example given is the design of the Basecamp calendar. The rough sketch made by the designer left out many details and thus left room for interpretation. But at the same time, the drawing was specific enough to show how the calendar should work and what needs to be built. Shaped work is defined by the following properties: it's rough (you can tell it's unfinished by looking at it), it's solved (it's been thought through), and it's bounded (it indicates what not to do). Shaping requires combining interface ideas with technical possibilities with business priorities.
