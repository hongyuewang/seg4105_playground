# Chapter 7

Pitches don't go into the backlog (which are a big waste of time due the accumulation of old tasks and the grooming and organizing of old ideas); they go onto a betting table where stakeholders periodically decide on pitches from the last six weeks. If a pitch is chosen, it proceeds onto the next work cycle, if not, it is discarded. If a valuable idea is not chosen, people can track it individually and vouch for it in a future meeting. There is not need to keep a centralized backlog, which means teams can keep their own lists of ideas.
