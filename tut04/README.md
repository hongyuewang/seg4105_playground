# Chapter 7

Pitches don't go into the backlog (which are a big waste of time due the accumulation of old tasks and the grooming and organizing of old ideas); they go onto a betting table where stakeholders periodically decide on pitches from the last six weeks. If a pitch is chosen, it proceeds onto the next work cycle, if not, it is discarded. If a valuable idea is not chosen, people can track it individually and vouch for it in a future meeting. There is not need to keep a centralized backlog, which means teams can keep their own lists of ideas.

# Chapter 8

The shapeup cycle lasts 6 weeks. This timespan allows for a cycle long enough to finish an entire project, but short enough to see the end from the beginning. There's also a cooldown period of 2 weeks in between each cycle for team members to rest, meet and decide what to do next. Programmers and designers will also have time to work on their own projects and explore new ideas. Team and project sizes also have to be standardized. Teams usually have one designer and one to two programmers per team. The team can either work on a single project for the entire cycle or multiple smaller projects. The betting table meeting is held during the cooldown period. The bets to consider are either new pitches or old pitches. The betting table at Basecamp consists of the CEO, CTO, a senior programmer and a product strategist. Bets have specific payouts. They are commitments: teams are working exclusively on a feature without interruptions for six weeks. Also, with bets, the most we have to lose is six weeks. When you make a bet, you do not let team members to be distracted or pulled away by something else.
