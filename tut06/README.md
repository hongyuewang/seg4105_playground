# Meeting Notes 

## October 10, 2023 4:00 - 5:00 PM

### Participants

Michael Bosciglio, Chetan Mandur, Marco Vethanayagam, Hong Yue Wang

### Purpose
Betting table to select a pitch to work on

### Topics discussed
- Went over everyone's pitches
- Decided our main criteria was to have enough work for each teammate.
- We did not choose Chetan's Raspberry Pi pitch since we realized in retrospect that it is not ideal to have all 4 programmers work on a single piece of hardware. Chetan is the only one who has experience with the Raspberry Pi on our team and it would make sense for him to work on it alone.
The same reason we did not pick Michael's pitch on updating the profiles page: we realized it was not enough work for 4 people over 6 weeks.
- We didn't choose Marco's 3D Modelling Pitch as the scope of what it intended to achieve did not meet with the time allocation provided. With a 4-member team working for an uninterrupted 6-weeks, the process of producing said feature would be done too quickly, making it an unviable pitch for the current cycle. This could be something we tackle as a personal ticket rather than a pitch.
- As a result of The Betting Table, the winning pitch was Hong Yue's Electron Desktop App. The main reason for this is because its scope and what it attempts to solve are important for our project and viable within the allocated time. The limitation of solely using a web application is that connection to the hardware is less secure and efficient. There also is no capability to create a desktop overlay for profile switching with a web app; this was one of the client's requirements and can only achieved with the solution identified in this pitch. Furthermore, the scope of the solution can be achieved within the 6-week allocation for our team size, furthering the importance of this pitch.
- Updated pitch from [Hong Yue's Github](https://github.com/hongyuewang/seg4105_playground/tree/main/lab03) which can be found [here](https://github.com/Macomatic/T40-Mouse-Accessibility-Attachment/blob/main/SEG4106_Deliverables/Deliverable_2/pitch.md)
