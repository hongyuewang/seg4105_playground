# Daily stand-up

The Daily Scrum is a vital 15-minute time-boxed event within the Scrum framework, primarily meant for the Development Team. This daily meeting is conducted during each day of the Sprint to facilitate efficient planning and collaboration. Its key objectives are to optimize team performance by reviewing the work done since the last Daily Scrum and projecting work for the upcoming 24 hours. Consistency is maintained by holding the Daily Scrum at the same time and place every day, reducing complexity and making it a routine part of the development process.

The primary purposes of the Daily Scrum include inspecting progress towards achieving the Sprint Goal and assessing how the progress aligns with completing the tasks in the Sprint Backlog. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the probability of the Development Team successfully meeting the Sprint Goal. Every day, the Development Team is expected to clarify how they plan to collaborate as a self-organizing unit, with the shared objective of achieving the Sprint Goal and delivering the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint.

The structure and format of the Daily Scrum are flexible and determined by the Development Team. The key focus should be on making progress towards the Sprint Goal. Teams may use various approaches, such as asking specific questions or engaging in open discussions. A common set of questions that can be used includes:

What tasks did I complete yesterday that contributed to the Sprint Goal?
What are my plans for today to support the Sprint Goal?
Do I encounter any impediments or obstacles that could hinder me or the team from reaching the Sprint Goal?
Following the Daily Scrum, it's common for the Development Team or its individual members to convene for further in-depth discussions, adapt their strategies, or replan the remaining work for the Sprint.

While the Scrum Master ensures that the Daily Scrum takes place, it is the Development Team's responsibility to conduct the meeting. The Scrum Master, in this context, serves as a facilitator and coach, guiding the team to stay within the 15-minute time-box. This ensures that the Daily Scrum remains focused and efficient.

Importantly, the Daily Scrum is an internal meeting intended exclusively for the Development Team. If there are observers or stakeholders present, the Scrum Master safeguards the integrity of the meeting by ensuring they do not disrupt the proceedings.

The benefits of the Daily Scrum are numerous. It enhances communication within the Development Team, reduces the need for additional meetings, identifies impediments to development that can be addressed promptly, promotes quick decision-making, and boosts the team's collective knowledge. It plays a critical role in the Scrum framework as an opportunity for continuous inspection and adaptation, helping teams make necessary adjustments and improvements throughout the Sprint.

# How to show progress

As a developer, you can employ the "hill chart" concept to effectively illustrate your task progress in a project:

1. Task Segmentation: Begin by breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable segments or scopes.

2. Visualize progress: Construct a hill chart wherein each scope is depicted as a point on the hill. The left side of the hill signifies uncertainty (uphill), while the right side signifies execution (downhill).

3. Track Your Progress: Shift the points on the hill chart as you make headway. Start at the bottom left (uncertainty), and progress to the right (execution) as you grow more confident in your approach and complete tasks.

4. Prevent Premature Progress: Refrain from relocating a scope to the top of the hill prematurely. Ensure that you've validated your approach and gained sufficient confidence before considering a scope as "solved."

5. Prioritization: Concentrate on addressing the most vital and uncertain tasks first, saving routine or less concerning work for later stages of the project.

6. Use the Hill Chart for Communication: The hill chart can function as a visual representation of your progress, simplifying discussions about your work with managers and team members.

By employing the hill chart method, you can effectively demonstrate your progress and convey the status of your tasks, eliminating the need for conventional status updates or estimates.
